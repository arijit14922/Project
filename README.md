# Project
In this project I have created a program where the program will import an excel from the file location we have given. After importing it will ask for the name of the sheet from which it will display data. If the sheet name is incorrect the process will get terminated. If we don't mention any sheet name then the program will read the first sheet of the excel file and display the data. If we mention the sheet name and the name exists in the file then the program will display the data in a tabular format.  The coding language used in this program is Python and the application used to run the program is IDLE of Python. The Code and the Excel file to display data is attached along with the screenshot of the result.
